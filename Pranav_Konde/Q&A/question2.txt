Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.
->You can have as many remotes as you want, but you can only have one remote named "origin". The " origin " remote is not special in any way, except that it is the default remote created by Git when you clone an existing repository. You can configure a second remote, push to/pull from that remote, and set up some branches to track branches from that remote instead of origin.

Use cases: It is easy to synchronize code between multiple git repositories, especially, pushing to multiple remotes.

Steps:

$ git remote add github URL

# push master to github
$ git push github master

# Push my-branch to github and set it to track github/my-branch
$ git push -u github my-branch

# Make some existing branch track github instead of origin
$ git branch --set-upstream other-branch github/other-branch
