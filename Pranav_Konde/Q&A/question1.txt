Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it?
->  Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch. In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.

Usage of cherry-pick
1. It is a handy tool for team collaboration.
2. It is necessary in case of bug fixing because bugs are fixed and tested in the development branch with their commits.
3. It is mostly used in undoing changes and restoring lost commits.
4. You can avoid useless conflicts by using git cherry-pick instead of other options.
5. It is a useful tool when a full branch merge is not possible due to incompatible versions in the various branches.
6. The git cherry-pick is used to access the changes introduced to a sub-branch, without changing the branch.

Steps 
1. git checkout <name of branch youâ€™d like to grab commit from>
2. git log
3. git checkout <name of branch you would like to add commit to>
4. git cherry-pick [-x] <commit hash>
