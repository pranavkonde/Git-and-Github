Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 
->  squash is used to squash the previous commits into one. It is not a command; instead, it is a keyword. The squash is an excellent technique for group-specific changes before forwarding them to others. You can merge several commits into a single commit with the compelling interactive rebase command.

Steps:

 git log --oneline  
 git rebase -i HEAD ~3  
 git push origin master
